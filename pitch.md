6. Connection with the offcial Reddit team, who are partners looking to grow reddit engagement

# Future Collaboration Ideas
1. Reddit AMAs: like Fariz Jabba 
	- Proven record of engagement with official content
	- The Japanese alternative chat, blackpink, drum chat are proof that users are enganged if the content is discursive
	- Draws on the inherent strengths of reddit, which is a consistent and clear way of connecting directly to the fans in a orderly format than a linear mode like telegram
	- Visibility post-event: Social media like instagram prioritises most recent content, while reddit has a more persistent visibility - often showing up as top posts when users join a group, or by sorting in the page
	- Engagement and conversations build trust
2. Occasional Verticals / Special Contributor (highlighted post)
	- adding as a named contributer and a touchpoint beyond usual social media - which are harder to find on google.
	- Redit's inherent advantage is still its visibility in google search, and on the front page of reddit.
3. Future plans: A website outside social media
	- The listings will have more user-submissions, rather than myself as a the central node, which increases reliability and time horizon
	- Possible Editorials: Thinking of how best to serve as public education for the arts in an accessible but non-pandering style, that elevates both local and international acts on an equal pedestal.

# Direction

- Ethos: Accessible but non-pandering ecosystem for arts-inclined people living in Singapore to keep track of interesting event for the time-scarce or arts-curious neophytes to begin their journey.
	- One that doesn't silo local and international acts as separate and respecting audiences need to be attending the most fulfilling arts events to their need.
