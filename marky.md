The Indie Film Listing - by Film Events Where SG x redditduk
------

redditduk: I've been following marky's telegram channel (Film Events Where SG `@FEWSbymarky`) since he took it upon himself to fill the Projector's void and he's been entertaining us every morning with his reactions & pics along with the listings. Anyway we've decided to collab last sunday so ta da! Marky will be adding his own flair while I do some formatting.

This reddit list will only be updated every Wednesday, so if you want the latest events hot off the press, follow Marky's channel!
